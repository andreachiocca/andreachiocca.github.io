Premature primary tooth loss can result in undesired tooth motions and space loss in the permanent dentition. Typically, fixed or removable dental appliances are adopted to maintain edentulous space until the eruption of permanent teeth. However, traditional space maintainers have limitations in terms of variability in tooth anatomy, potential allergic reactions in some individuals (i.e., nickel sensitivity), difficulties in maintaining oral hygiene, and patient acceptance. The present study introduces a fully digital framework for the design and manufacturing of customized pediatric unilateral space maintainers using generative algorithms. The proposed approach overcomes the current challenges by using a biocompatible resin material and optimizing the device’s size, design, and color. The methodology involves intraoral scanning, surface selection, and trim, generative 3D modeling, finite element analysis (FEA), and additive manufacturing (AM) through vat photopolymerization. FEA results demonstrate the device’s mechanical performance and reliability, while additive manufacturing ensures design freedom, high resolution, surface finishing, dimensional accuracy, and proper fit. The mechanical interlocking system facilitates easy and effective positioning of the device. This digital approach offers the potential for wider usage of space maintainers and can be further validated through experimental assessments and clinical studies.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Chiocca2023a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Rapid and accurate fatigue assessment by an efficient critical plane algorithm: application to a FSAE car rear upright</div> <div class="author"> <em>Andrea Chiocca</em>, M.

Between the most known frequency methods, there are Bendat’s method, valid for narrow-band signals, and Dirlik’s formula, which ifis considered the best result for wide-band signals. However, a great part of the frequency methods takes the rainflow count as a reference time-domain method and uses the rainflow damage computation as the exact value to emulate. Therefore, very few experimental data for the fatigue life of mechanical components subject to random loads are available in the literature. This work presents the setup for a series of experimental tests for specimens subjected to random loads, aiming at achieving experimental data to compare with the results provided by frequency methods. After a brief description of the materials used for the setup, the two-step test concept is described: first, the specimen will be subjected to random loads obtained by a certain power spectral density for an amount of time which should nominally cause a 30% of damage; then, the fatigue test will be ended on a resonance testing machine to compute the actual residual fatigue life of the specimen; this two-step testing also allows to reduce the time requested for the tests. The test bench developed for the experimental investigation is described in the paper, together with the results of some preliminary tests, aimed at verifying the feasibility of the conceived procedure.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Chiocca2023b" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Closed-form solution for the Fatemi-Socie extended parameter in case of linear elasticity and proportional loading</div> <div class="author"> <em>Andrea Chiocca</em>, Michele Sgamma, and Francesco Frendo</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Fatigue &amp; Fracture of Engineering Materials &amp; Structures</em>, Oct 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2023_Fatigue%20Fract%20Eng%20Mat%20Struct.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Fatigue damage remains a significant issue for both metallic and non-metallic components, being the main cause of in-service failures. Among the different assessment methodologies, critical plane methods have gained significance as they enable identifying the critical location and the early crack propagation orientation. However, the standard plane scanning method used for calculating critical plane factors is computationally intensive, and as a result, it is usually applied only when the component’s critical region is known in advance. In the presence of complex geometries, loads, or constraints, a more efficient method would be required. This work presents a closed‐form solution to efficiently evaluate a critical plane factor based on the Fatemi‐Socie criterion, in the case of isotropic linear‐elastic material behavior and proportional loading conditions.

Fatigue damage still represents a major issue for both metallic and non-metallic components, sometimes leading to unforeseen failures for in-service parts. Among all the assessment methodologies, critical plane methods gained a lot of relevance, as they allow the identification of the component’s critical location and the direction of early crack propagation. However, the standard method employed for calculating critical plane factors is very time-consuming as it makes use of nested for/end loops and, for that reason, it is usually applied in a research context, or when the critical areas of the component are known. Very often, however, the critical regions cannot be identified, due to complex geometries, loads or constraints, or the fatigue assessment has to be carried out with tight time scheduling, which is typical of the industry. In this work, an efficient algorithm for calculating critical plane factors, useful to speed up the fatigue assessment process, is presented. The algorithm applies to all critical plane factors that require the maximization of a specific parameter based on stress and strain components or a combination of them. The methodology maximizes the parameter utilizing tensor invariants and coordinates transformation law. In order to validate the proposed methodology, without loosing generality, the Fatemi-Socie critical plane factor was considered. The new algorithm was tested on different geometries (i.e. hourglass, notched and welded joint geometries) under different loading conditions (i.e. proportional/non-proportional, uniaxial and multiaxial loading) and showed a significant reduction in computation time respect the standard plane scanning method, without any loss of solution accuracy.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Fontana2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Numerical-experimental characterization of the dynamic behavior of PCB for the fatigue analysis of PCBa</div> <div class="author"> F.

Because of the widespread adoption of 3D modeling of large and complex structures in the industry, the PSM has recently been boosted by including four-node and ten-node tetrahedral elements of Ansys FE software, which allows to discretize complex geometries. In this paper, a Round Robin among eleven Italian Universities has been performed to calibrate the PSM with seven different commercial FE software packages. Several 3D mode I, II and III problems have been considered to investigate the influence of (i) FE code, (ii) element type, (iii) mesh pattern, and (iv) procedure to extrapolate stresses at FE nodes. The majority of the adopted FE software packages present similar values of the PSM parameters, the main source of discrepancy being the stress extrapolation method at FE nodes.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Chiocca2022a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effects of coating on the fatigue endurance of FDM lattice structures</div> <div class="author"> <em>Andrea Chiocca</em>, Francesco Tamburrino, Francesco Frendo, and Alessandro Paoli</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Procedia Structural Integrity</em>, Apr 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="/assets/pdf/2022_1-s2.0-S2452321622006588-main.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Chiocca2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Influence of residual stresses on the fatigue life of welded joints.

Furthermore, the loading conditions and the component geometry have to be taken into account. The problem of considering the singular influences adequately is intensified by their interactions, which invokes a simultaneous treatment of all relevant influencing factors. Without predefinition of the fatigue approach, properties to describe the cyclic aspects of component behaviour and the fatigue life are required. Even in the case of using small sized specimens, it is not possible to produce a defect-free material for studying the behaviour of sound material in order to derive cyclic material properties as a requirement for the local strain-based fatigue concept, or in order to derive a reference SN-curve and knock-down factors for load-based concepts. Analysing the microstructure offers additional information about the local material state, because, depending on the lightening strategy, the material can be divided into different areas (up-skin, down-skin, contour, core, etc.) with characteristic distributions of imperfections. In order to use a conventional fatigue approach method, this information is not sufficient, because the interaction of statistically distributed imperfections is superimposed on the effect of singular defects. Due to these reasons and after introducing a new interpretation of the measured stress and strain, a fatigue approach will be discussed, which is based on a combined experimental and numerical derivation of the required local properties of the so-called representative structure elements. In addition to the reduced numerical effort compared to the conventional approaches, a combined experimental and numerical derivation of RSE properties is enabled.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Chiocca2022b" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Residual stresses influence on the fatigue strength of structural components</div> <div class="author"> <em>Andrea Chiocca</em>, Francesco Frendo, and Leonardo Bertini</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Procedia Structural Integrity</em>, Jan 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2022_1-s2.0-S245232162200258X-main.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Several production processes, both conventional and innovative, may result in residual stresses arising in critical areas of a component. The main issues include high distortion, reduced fatigue life, fracturing or delamination. In this context, standard fatigue design codes traditionally consider residual stresses through conservative assumptions, leading to either sub-optimal design or unexpected failures. Recently, innovative computational techniques have been developed to address residual stresses in a more comprehensive way. As a result, a more effective material utilisation and a more accurate fatigue life assessment can be achieved. The present work examines the influence of residual stresses on the fatigue endurance of S355JR structural steel components. Both welded and notched components were analysed, carrying out numerical and experimental analyses. In the case of welded components, residual stresses resulting from the welding process were numerically evaluated by means of an uncoupled thermal-structural simulation, while for notched specimens a preload causing limited yielding was used to induce a local residual stress field comparable to that obtained for welded specimens nearby the critical locations. Even if he work is still in progress, tests carried out with different specimens under different loading conditions allowed to understand the effect of residual stresses on the fatigue life.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="ChioccaPHD" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Influence of residual stresses on the fatigue life of welded joints</div> <div class="author"> <em>Andrea Chiocca</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>University of Pisa</em>, Jan 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/Thesis_compressed.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>A deep knowledge of the production process is needed, in order to achieve quality and safety requirements in a structural component. As a matter of fact, manufacturing processes can introduce defects such as residual stresses, internal and superficial imperfections. Together with the inherent geometric variations, such as notches, cracks or defects in general, it is often difficult to precisely characterise the structural strength of such parts. In this context, residual stresses play an important role, especially in welded structures. The evaluation of residual stresses is typically performed using both experimental and numerical methods. Both present strengths and drawbacks which demand their combined usage to achieve a consistent and meaningful evaluation of the residual stresses. Within this scope, this PhD thesis presents an evaluation of residual stresses in a pipe-to-plate welded joint and studied their influence on the fatigue life of torsionally and bending loaded components. In the first part, the finite element method was used to assess the capability of different thermal methods used to simulate a single pass of the gas metal arc welding process in reproducing the temperature distribution around the weld bead. Results of the simulations were compared to experimental measurements of the surface temperature close to the weld region. The considered thermal techniques adopted different levels of complexity, from the basic implementation of a constant initial temperature assigned to a given material volume, to the more comprehensive and widespread Goldak’s double-ellipsoid model. The study shows that, close to the weld seam, very similar thermal behaviours can be achieved by employing each one of the analysed methods. Secondly, considering the constant initial temperature method, the comparison between experimental measurements and numerical simulations showed a fairly good agreement, suggesting that a relatively simple method (i.e., requiring the setting of only one parameter) can be used to efficiently reproduce the thermal history of a welding process. In the second part, the study of residual stresses for a S355JR carbon steel pipe-to-plate welded joint is presented. Numerical simulations and experimental tests were both employed in order to gain wide-ranging knowledge. Numerical simulations were performed with the software Ansys through uncoupled thermal-structural simulations in order to evaluate the stresses, strains and temperature at each node of the finite element model for each phase of the simulation. Temperature-dependent elastic-plastic material properties were adopted in combination with the \backslashtextit{element birth \backslash&amp; death} method to simulate the welding process. Two different numerical approaches were implemented for reproducing the weld seam solidification process. The obtained results were discussed and compared with experimental data, in terms of relaxed radial strains measured nearby the seam weld, due to a material removal procedure. The third part investigates the influence of residual stresses on the fatigue life of the welded joints. Influencing factors such as geometric discontinuities and the material heterogeneous microstructure were considered. Experimental tests on as-welded and stress relieved specimens with fully reversed torsion and bending loading conditions were carried out. Experimental results showed how residual stresses exhibited an influence mainly on torsionally loaded components. Numerically, the uncoupled thermal-structural finite element simulation presented in the chapters before was used to assess the complete residual stress field within the specimens. Secondly, residual stresses were mapped and included as initial condition in numerical models intended for fatigue damage factors calculation. Finally, experimental results were then used to corroborate numerical models and verify their efficacy in assessing fatigue endurance. In the last part of this work, a preliminary numerical study of a notched specimen geometry is presented. The work attempts to reproduce residual stress conditions comparable to those found on the welded joint critical notch section on notched specimens thus in order to explain the results observed on welded specimens. Indeed, by varying notch radius and opening angle of a cylindrical specimen, it is possible to obtain a stress gradient similar to that obtained after the welding process at the weld notches. The use of simplified geometry allows easier analysis and a possible improved understanding of the processes taking place within the material.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Chiocca2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Evaluation of residual stresses in a pipe-to-plate welded joint by means of uncoupled thermal-structural simulation and experimental tests</div> <div class="author"> <em>Andrea Chiocca</em>, Francesco Frendo, and Leonardo Bertini</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>International Journal of Mechanical Sciences</em>, Jun 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2021_1-s2.0-S0020740321001363-main.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> Fatigue of structural components is a widely discussed subject on which extensive research is still being carried out, both in the scientific and industrial communities. Fatigue damage remains a major issue for both metallic and non-metallic components, sometimes resulting in unforeseen failures for in-service parts. Among all the assessment methodologies, critical plane methods have gained relevance as they allow the identification of the component’s critical location and the direction of early crack propagation. However, the standard method for calculating critical plane factors is time-consuming, typically involving nested loops, and is mainly used in a research context or when the critical areas of the component are known. Often, though, critical regions cannot be identified due to complex geometries, loads, constraints, or the need for rapid industry-based fatigue assessments. In this work, an efficient algorithm for calculating critical plane factors, aimed at expediting the fatigue assessment process, is presented. The algorithm applies to all critical plane factors that require the maximization of a specific parameter based on stress and strain components or their combinations. The methodology maximizes the parameter using tensor invariants and coordinate transformation laws. To validate the proposed methodology, without losing generality, the "Fatemi-Socie" critical plane factor was considered. The new algorithm was tested on different geometries (e.g., hourglass, notched, and welded joint geometries) under various loading conditions (e.g., proportional/non-proportional, uniaxial, and multiaxial loading) and demonstrated a significant reduction in computation time compared to the standard plane scanning method, without compromising solution accuracy.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Frendo2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Fatigue life assessment of welded joints under sequences of bending and torsion loading blocks of different lengths</div> <div class="author"> Francesco Frendo, Giuseppe Marulo, <em>Andrea Chiocca</em>, and Leonardo Bertini</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Fatigue and Fracture of Engineering Materials and Structures</em>, Jun 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2020_ffe.13223.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In this work, the nominal stress concept, the notch stress approach and two critical plane approaches are used to analyse the fatigue endurance of a pipe-to-plate welded joint subjected to complex loading histories. Both the pipe and the plate were made of S355JR steel. Starting from already known fatigue endurance curves obtained for the same specimens under pure bending and pure torsion, a first series of tests was conducted, in which specimens were loaded in bending for a given fraction of the estimated life and then in torsion until failure. A similar series of tests was then carried out by changing the loading order: specimens were firstly loaded in torsion for a given fraction of the estimated endurance and then in bending until failure. The whole test campaign was repeated for two different fractions of the estimated life, that is, 0.3 and 0.45, respectively. After that, additional three series of tests were carried out, in which the specimens were subjected to consecutive sequences of bending and torsion blocks of different lengths (short, medium and long, respectively); the relative length of the bending and torsion block in each series was determined in order to produce the same damage. The experimental results, in terms of total damage at failure, were analysed using the Palmgren–Miner hypothesis. For all the assessment methods, the characteristic endurance curves were firstly calibrated on the basis of finite element (FE) analyses and of the experimental results obtained under pure bending and pure torsion loadings. The observed damage at failure resulted always greater than 0.5 for all the employed methods and greater than 1 for most of the tests. The different methods gave similar results, with the critical plane methods giving a slightly more stable damage at failure and a correct determination of the failure location. For all the methods, the damage at failure slightly reduces as the block length shortens.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Chiocca2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Experimental evaluation of relaxed strains in a pipe-to-plate welded joint by means of incremental cutting process</div> <div class="author"> <em>Andrea Chiocca</em>, Francesco Frendo, and Leonardo Bertini</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Procedia Structural Integrity</em>, Jan 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="/assets/pdf/2020_Procedia_Structural_Integrity_Experimental%20evaluation%20of%20relaxed%20strains.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Chiocca2019c" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Evaluation of residual stresses in a tube-to-plate welded joint</div> <div class="author"> <em>Andrea Chiocca</em>, Francesco Frendo, and Leonardo Bertini</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>MATEC Web of Conferences</em>, Jan 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2019_matecconf_icmff1218_19005.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>A deep understanding of the manufacturing process is needed in order to achieve safety and quality requirements for parts and components; to this regard, residual stresses play an important role in welded structures. Residual stresses are mainly caused by the extremely severe thermal cycle to which the welded metal and base material are subjected to during welding process and their knowledge leads to a better static and fatigue assessment of welded joints. This work deals with the study of residual stresses for a tube to plate T-joint, made of S355JR carbon steel. The work was carried out by both numerical simulations and experimental tests. The numerical simulations were performed by Ansys FE code through a structural-thermal full transient analysis to evaluate stress, strain and temperature in each node at each step of the simulation. The “birth and death” method was employed, together with temperature-dependent material properties.A2Danda3D simulation were performed, in order to evaluate possible diﬀerences due to the welding process. Numerical results were compared to some preliminary measurements obtained through an incremental cut made on the plate.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Chiocca2019b" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Evaluation of heat sources for the simulation of the temperature distribution in gas metal arc welded joints</div> <div class="author"> <em>Andrea Chiocca</em>, Francesco Frendo, and Leonardo Bertini</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Metals</em>, Jan 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2019_metals-09-01142-v2.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Residual stresses can affect both the static strength and the fatigue endurance of welded joints. Residual stresses can be assessed by numerical simulation; however, the simulation of the welding process is a complex task that requires knowledge of several parameters, many of which can only be estimated with some uncertainty. The reduction in the number of these parameters can lead to a more feasible and efficient study. In this work, the finite element method is used to assess the capability of different thermal methods used to simulate a single pass of the gas metal arc welding process in reproducing the temperature distribution around the weld. Results of the simulations are compared to experimental measurements of the surface temperature close to the welding area. The thermal techniques analyzed adopt different levels of complexity, from the basic implementation of a constant initial temperature assigned to a given material volume, to the more comprehensive and widespread Goldak’s double-ellipsoid model. The study shows that, close to the weld seam, very similar thermal behaviors can be achieved by employing each one of the analyzed methods. Secondly, considering the constant initial temperature method, the comparison between experimental measurements and numerical simulations showed a fairly good agreement, suggesting that a relatively simple method (i.e., requiring the setting of only one parameter) can be used to efficiently reproduce the thermal history of a welding process.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 Andrea Chiocca.

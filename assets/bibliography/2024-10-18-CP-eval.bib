abstract = {Abstract— A modification to Brown and Miller's critical plane approach is proposed to predict multiaxial fatigue life under both in‐phase and out‐of‐phase loading conditions. The components of this modified parameter consist of the maximum shear strain amplitude and the maximum normal stress on the maximum shear strain amplitude plane. Additional cyclic hardening developed during out‐of‐phase loading is included in the normal stress term. Also, the mathematical formulation of this new parameter is such that variable amplitude loading can be accommodated. Experimental results from tubular specimens made of 1045 HR steel under in‐phase and 90° out‐of‐phase axial‐torsional straining using both sinusoidal and trapezoidal wave forms were correlated within a factor of about two employing this approach. Available Inconel 718 axial‐torsional data including mean strain histories were also satisfactorily correlated using the aforementioned parameter. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1988, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract = {Material fatigue is extensively discussed and researched within scientific and industrial communities. Fatigue damage poses a significant challenge for both metallic and non-metallic components, often resulting in unexpected failures of in-service parts. Within multiaxial fatigue assessment, critical plane methods have gained importance due to their ability to characterize a component's critical location and detect early crack propagation. However, the conventional approach to calculate critical plane factors is time-consuming, making it primarily suitable for research purposes or when critical regions are already known. In many real-world scenarios, identifying the critical area of a component is difficult due to complex geometries, varying loads, or time limitations. This challenge becomes particularly crucial after topological optimization of components and in the context of lightweight design. Recently, the authors proposed an efficient method for evaluating critical plane factors in closed form, applicable to all cases that necessitate the maximization of specific parameters based on stress and strain components or their combination. This paper presents and validates the proposed methodology, with reference to a rear upright of a FSAE car, which is characterized by a complex geometry and is subjected to non-proportional loading conditions. The efficient algorithm demonstrated a substantial reduction in computation time compared to the standard plane scanning method, while maintaining solution accuracy.},

abstract = {The topic of material fatigue is a subject extensively investigated within both scientific and industrial worlds. Fatigue-induced damage remains a critical concern for a variety of components, encompassing both metallic and non-metallic materials, often leading to unexpected failures during their operational lifecycle. In cases necessitating the assessment of multiaxial fatigue, critical plane methodologies have emerged as a valuable approach. These methodologies offer the means to pinpoint the component's critical regions and anticipate early-stage crack propagation. Nevertheless, the conventional technique (i.e., plane scanning method) for computing critical plane factors is a time-intensive process, reliant on nested iterations, predominantly suited for research purposes. In numerous cases, where the critical area within a component is unknown in advance (i.e., primarily due to complex geometries and loading conditions) the method proves impractical. Furthermore, the plane scanning method does not provide a deep comprehension of the critical plane concept; indeed, it is just a numerical artifice for calculating stress and strain quantities on different planes. Recently, the authors introduced an efficient algorithm for evaluating critical plane factors. This algorithm is based on a closed form solution and is applicable to all instances where the maximization of a specific parameter, based on stress or strain components, is required. The methodology relies on tensor invariants and coordinates transformation principles thus enhancing the investigation of various critical plane methods. The paper addresses two formulations of the Fatemi-Socie critical plane factor and discusses how the number of critical planes depend on the loading conditions the component is subjected to. By the use of a closed form solution a deep insight of critical planes orientation can be achieved.},

abstract = {Fatigue of structural components is a widely discussed subject on which extensive research is still being carried out, both in the scientific and industrial communities. Fatigue damage still represents a major issue for both metallic and non-metallic components, sometimes leading to unforeseen failures for in-service parts. Among all the assessment methodologies, critical plane methods gained a lot of relevance, as they allow the identification of the component's critical location and the direction of early crack propagation. However, the standard method employed for calculating critical plane factors is very time-consuming as it makes use of nested for/end loops and, for that reason, it is usually applied in a research context, or when the critical areas of the component are known. Very often, however, the critical regions cannot be identified, due to complex geometries, loads or constraints, or the fatigue assessment has to be carried out with tight time scheduling, which is typical of the industry. In this work, an efficient algorithm for calculating critical plane factors, useful to speed up the fatigue assessment process, is presented. The algorithm applies to all critical plane factors that require the maximization of a specific parameter based on stress and strain components or a combination of them. The methodology maximizes the parameter utilizing tensor invariants and coordinates transformation law. In order to validate the proposed methodology, without loosing generality, the Fatemi-Socie critical plane factor was considered. The new algorithm was tested on different geometries (i.e. hourglass, notched and welded joint geometries) under different loading conditions (i.e. proportional/non-proportional, uniaxial and multiaxial loading) and showed a significant reduction in computation time respect the standard plane scanning method, without any loss of solution accuracy.},

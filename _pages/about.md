I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Pisa, specializing in structural engineering. My research focuses on residual stress analysis and fatigue assessment of welded structures and additive manufactured components, using advanced numerical techniques and efficient algorithms to enhance material application and component safety. I actively contribute to academic conferences, and my work has practical applications in improving the reliability of structural components.

As an Assistant Professor at the University of Pisa, I am dedicated to [research](/publications/), [education](/teaching/), and the [dissemination](/repositories/) of knowledge in the field of structural engineering.

The <a href='http://machinedesign.ing.unipi.it/'>research group</a> expertise extends to vehicle design, multibody dynamics, structural dynamics, and mechanics of materials. We are committed to sharing knowledge and insights through joint collaborations.
